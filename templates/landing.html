                      Arya Public School has over the years earned a name in the adjoining areas and is serving the society in the field of Education to help needy students, since 1988. Our school is a branch of that sprawling Arya Samaj, which is rooted in ancient Indian Tradition but which reaches out to the sky. Being a part of such an illustrious organization we have a tremendous responsibility. We are conscious of the fact that we have to fulfill the sacred mission of visionaries like Swami Dayanand, who lit the torch of education when our country was reeling in the darkness of illiteracy, superstition. We have built our school step by step and brick by brick. We endeavor to acquaint our children with Vedic culture and teach them to be morally upright but at the same time, we impart them modern vision so that they remain abreast with the fast-changing world. We give our students opportunities to realize their talents and potential through Inter-School and Inter-House Competitions. We are fortunate that we have a highly qualified staff who constantly sharpen their knowledge and intellect by attending seminars and workshops. All the development and progress is possible where the administration is perfect. Our administrative staff members are doing their best to maintain discipline and achieving great heights in all spheres. We want to give our best to our students. Nurturing curiosity, ambition, self-confidence, responsibility, and integrity shall always be our motto.

                      Learning literally means knowledge acquired by studying. The years of a child in school are very critical for the growth and development of an individual. We, at APS, intend and strive to ignite this fire in the minds and hearts of our children right from an early stage and consequently move ahead on the path of enlightenment of the entire world through education which comprises a series of achievements and accomplishments each raising the individual to a higher level of awareness, understanding, and kinship with everything around them. APS education, guided by the school’s vision, mission, and values, was conceptualized by me and aims to prepare each student to be successful, engaged, and informed citizens in the 21st century who are caring, knowledgeable, imaginative, innovative, hardworking, and productive. To achieve that, we act on the Principles of Education upholding the school motto, “Truth”… “Determination”… and “Perseverance’, which are categorized into Head, Heart, Skills, and Feet to better reflect the holistic development of each student in our care: Responsible, disciplined and dynamic learners (Head); Compassionate individuals with the passion to serve (Heart); confident, adaptable and innovative individuals prepared for the challenges ahead (skills); Resident citizen with integrity.

                      Since Independence, India has made lots of progress in the field of Education. Today’s education is available for all, unlike the previous years without any discrimination. It has the power to bring about human development and economic enrichment, establish equality and promote social justice. Children are our future and it is their right to live with dignity and respect and be molded as responsible citizens. Keeping this motto in mind, we have made a lot of different activities as a part of our syllabus in addition to academic pursuits. Our major Projects for this and subsequent years which is being adopted and propagated in the school activities is the ‘CLEANLINESS’ in all respect. ‘Cleanliness is next to Godliness’ is a well-said quote. Our respected leaders are laying stress on this project to be compulsorily adopted by all the schools. So parent involvement in this project is very much needed. They must see that their wards come to school in neat and clean dresses. Attention must be paid to the cleanliness of body, teeth, hair, nails, polishing shoes, and also daily bath. Well-dressed students always remain ahead of others because they are active, mentally alert, agile, and always ready to put forward their best in every respect. Our school has adopted a HOUSE SYSTEM. All the students have been divided into Four Houses. Individual House Meetings are held once a month. Here students are taught, trained, and encouraged to put forward their views/performance/oration skill/discourses/discussions, etc. Sometimes Painting / dance / drama / songs/ debates etc. are also taken up. Students take part / perform according to their choice/likings. In this way, their hidden inborn qualities are exploited. Once a month Inter-House Competitions are also held. Arts and crafts classes are held regularly, and it is a part of the syllabus. Children enjoy participating in these classes. A full-time Instructor imparts not only physical education activities but also trains the students in the field of Marshal Art which is the necessity of the time. It is a very useful and powerful activity which keeps the body fit and also trains the youngsters for self-defense in case of emergency and danger. In this fast-developing age of modern technology, training in the field of computers and related activities is a must. This training is imparted by a full-time trained Teacher. We have a well-equipped Computer room fitted with AC and nearly twenty computers. A well-equipped Library with a full-time Librarian is a jewel in the crown of the school’s activities. Students are encouraged and exposed exhaustively to study extra syllabus books/material. They can take home the books they like. In this way, they are exposed to the most important habit of ‘Reading’. Teachers of the school devote nearly half an hour extra time after their duty hours. They utilize this time not in any idle gossip or activity but in preparing their next day's lectures, presentations, checking papers or exercise books; organizing academic events, and attending various meetings. So this extra time is a very useful tool in the hands of teachers. On the last Sunday of every month students whose Birthday falls in that month, are called to Arya Samaj along with their parents. HawanYagya is performed, lots of blessings are showered, lecture in Moral Education is delivered by some luminary in this field and all students are presented with certain gifts. Parents and children enjoy this type of Birthday Celebration. In addition to these activities, we exhort the students to participate in inter-school / Zonal level extracurricular activities or competitions such as dance/drama/debates/songs or physical activities. At the school level, we also organize Annual Day Function, celebrate Independence and Republic Day; social or Religious Programmes wherein local leaders or luminaries are called to bless and guide the children. Students enjoy taking part in these activities very enthusiastically. Once in a year, students are taken out of school for outings also. These are just glimpses of the school activities which play a vital role in the all-round development of the student personality.
